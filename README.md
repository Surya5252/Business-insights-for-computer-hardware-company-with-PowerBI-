Business insights for computer hardware company -Built a Power BI dashboard for sales and inventory  analysis to help leadership identify underperforming product lines
## Computer Hardware Manufacturing Industry 
- Data Analysis Project Execution:
1.	Uploaded Raw Data to SQL Server:
Imported the raw dataset into SQL Server and performed benchmarking to validate the data quality and integrity.
2.	Connected SQL Server to Power BI:
Established a live connection between SQL Server and Power BI to import the validated data, and began the data transformation and cleaning process using Power Query.
3.	Created Measures and Calculated Columns:
Based on client requirements, developed key measures and calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful insights from the raw data.
4.	Designed Visual Reports in Power BI:
After building the necessary DAX calculations, I implemented visual reports according to client specifications, creating an interactive and insightful BI report for business analysis
## Insights Through Visualizations
I’m excited to share the results of my latest Data Analysis project! 
I performed extensive cleaning, exploration, and visualization using a structured data set to uncover key business insights. Here's a detailed breakdown of the visual reports created:
